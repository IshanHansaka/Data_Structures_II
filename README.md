This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java. It supports basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

- ✅ Insertion of nodes
- ✅ Deletion of nodes  
  - Leaf node  
  - Node with one child  
  - Node with two children
- ✅ Search for a value
- ✅ Traversals  
  - Preorder (DFS)  
  - Inorder (DFS)  
  - Postorder (DFS)  
  - Level Order (BFS)
